# CSS Alphabetize

CSS Alphabetize is a simple VS Code extension for organizing CSS rules alphabetically.

## TODO:

As of right now, the only function this extension provides is the sorting of .css files.

- Add organizing for .scss, .less, .sass files.
- Add organizing for styles embedded in components.
- Learn more about edge cases/error handling for those cases.
